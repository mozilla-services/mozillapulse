Overview
--------------------------------------------

Mozilla pulse is a prototype event manager / message broker. Documentation will maybe live at pulse.mozilla.org

This library is a thin wrapper above others to make connecting to Mozilla Pulse
easier. The mozillapulse library is very immature but still fairly useful.

It may change completely in the future.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------

* carrot (http://github.com/ask/carrot)

Example consumer script:
--------------------------------------------

# Import our consumers from the lib
from mozillapulse import consumers

# Define a callback
def got_message(data, message):
    # Show we got something
    print "GOT MESSAGE: %s %s" % (data, message)
    # Ack the message so it is removed form the queue
    message.ack()

# Make a consumer that listens to HG events (commit, closed, opened, etc)
# Note we don't give a user/paassword so it uses the default (public/public)
# Also note the applabel should be unique as the message broker does
# round-robin delivery when there are more than one connection to a queue
# (which the applabel defines). you likely don't want that behavior
pulse = consumers.HgConsumer(applabel='clegnitto@mozilla.com|mycoolapp')

# Tell the broker what we want to listen for ('#' is everything) and give our
# callback
pulse.configure(topic='#', callback=got_event)

# You can do this so that old/unprocessed messages in the queue are deleted
# before you start processing
# pulse.purge_existing_messages()

# Block and call the callback function when a message comes in
pulse.listen()


Example producer script:
--------------------------------------------

# Import the pulse publishers
from mozillapulse import publishers

# import some pre-baked message types
# Note messages can really be anything, these are just to make it clear
# for producers
from mozillapulse.messages import hg

# Make a publisher (can't use public/public as it doesn't have access)
pulse = publishers.HgPublisher(user="", password="")

# Message to send
mymessage = hg.HgCommitMessage('mozilla-1.9.2')

# Fill some fake data, as the messages validate themselves and 
# HgCommitMessage requires these fields to be there
for x in ['who','when','changeset','message','link']:
    mymessage.set_data(x, 'Fake %s data' % x)

# Send the message to the broker through the proper exchange with the correct
# routing key and payload
pulse.publish(mymessage)

# Disconnect to be nice to the server
pulse.disconnect()
